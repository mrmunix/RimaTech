<h1>Micro CMSv1</h1>
<p>Title: Micro-CMS v1
Difficulty: East
Skills: Web
Flags: 4</p>
<h1 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the name:
CMS is a Content Management System, so even before loading it up, I can see that it will probably be about some lightweight cms they give us</p>
<p>Loading the page we get:
<img src="../../writeups/hacker101/microcms-v1/Images/startpage.png" alt="Can&rsquo;t Find Image"></p>
<p>Plan of attack: Click on each option and peruse&hellip;.</p>
<p>Selecting the Testing link brings you to a new page which I wil go into in a second, but first, I see this url:</p>
<p><a href="https://9c01fd118736ac24fe91535c675778ec.ctf.hacker101.com/page/1">https://9c01fd118736ac24fe91535c675778ec.ctf.hacker101.com/page/1</a></p>
<p>I see the &ldquo;/page/1&rdquo; at then end and am curious if there are more pages. Let&rsquo;s start up burp and get the fuzzer working. (look at the how to page (if I have it up and running which it currently is not) to see how to fuzz on burp and how to connect burp to your browser)</p>
<p>As I wait to get burp started, here&rsquo;s a quick tip: Use multiple monitors&hellip;. I am on my laptop and window management is a pain</p>
<p>In the intruder, I put marks around the 1 in the get request, select a payload of number from 1 to 100 and let it rip. I have the community edition so this may take a while.</p>
<p><img src="../../writeups/hacker101/microcms-v1/Images/TestingIntruder.png" alt="Can&rsquo;t Find Image"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also quickly going to navigate the provided pages to see what numbers it gives me</p>
<p>Testing &hellip;. 1
Markdown Test &hellip;. 2</p>
<p>and thats it so far</p>
<p>Well, sorting by status codes gives me:
page 1&hellip; 200
page 2&hellip; 200
and then page 4&hellip; 403 (forbidden) I like this page, we should try it later
the rest give me 404 not found.</p>
<p>Back to page 1 (Testing)
If I select Edit this page, it brings me here:
<img src="../../writeups/hacker101/microcms-v1/Images/editpage.png" alt="Can&rsquo;t Find Image">
It tells me Markdown is supported but scripts are not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Javascript in the Title field</li>
<li>Javascript in the big textbox</li>
<li>embedded code in the Markdown file</li>
</ol>
<p>option 1 and 2 didnt work
I got fixated on option 3 and nothing was working, but in the process I had an idea. The response page returned a <code>&lt;h1&gt;title&lt;/h1&gt;</code> for whatever was in the title field. So in the title field, I put <code>&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;a&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h1&gt;</code> which closes the first h1 tag, makes my own a tag, and opens up another h1 tag to be closed
My though was maybe I can use this to find a link to some flag.txt page, but upon hitting save and Go Home it gave a pop up with a flag.</p>
<p>Wow. ok 1 down 3 to go.</p>
<p>So now we go to the Markdown Test page:
<img src="../../writeups/hacker101/microcms-v1/Images/MarkdownTestPage.png" alt="Can&rsquo;t Find Image">
I see up top there is an &ldquo;Edit this page&rdquo; link and &ldquo;Some button&rdquo; down below. This screams &ldquo;TWO FLAGS OVER HERE!&rdquo; to me.</p>
<p>So we go to edit this page, I see that the button is simply created with html flags I know that any mention of the word &ldquo;script&rdquo; is banned, so maybe this will only be one flag? We shall see.</p>
<p>The page doesnt like to save when my proxy is connected so i shut it off. I&rsquo;m keeping burp open though in case I need it.
Never mind, I had to just restart the server&hellip; ok where was I</p>
<p>The button tags can use the onClick method to put in some javascript, but I don&rsquo;t have a use for that now, so putting that in my back pocket.</p>
<p>Ok&hellip; a little bit random, but I realized the edit pages took you to <code>https://&lt;url&gt;/pages/edit/&lt;number&gt;</code>
so i went to the edit page for number 4 and got another flag&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="../../writeups/hacker101/microcms-v1/Images/edit4flag.png" alt="Can&rsquo;t Find Image"></p>
<p>Well.. I shut off my proxy cause I thought it was causing issues, so it took me a suuuper long time to find the 3rd flag. But once I reconnected it, I saw that after I edited the page (I&rsquo;m sure it was there before too), I added <code>onClick=&quot;alert(123)</code> to the button tag to test it out, but in the response shown in burpsuit the button had a <code>flag=&lt;flag&gt;</code> attribute already associated. *sigh* sometimes it really is that easy.</p>
<p>Ok on to flag #4</p>
<p>For our last link: Create New Page
<img src="../../writeups/hacker101/microcms-v1/Images/createNewPage.png" alt="Can&rsquo;t Find Image">
let&rsquo;s just put some random content and look at the response</p>
<p><img src="../../writeups/hacker101/microcms-v1/Images/createpagecontent.png" alt="Can&rsquo;t Find Image">
<img src="../../writeups/hacker101/microcms-v1/Images/createpageburp.png" alt="Can&rsquo;t Find Image">
cool little note, this created a page &ldquo;page/9&rdquo; and the edit page is &ldquo;edit/9&rdquo; which is pretty neat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be honest, i&rsquo;m a little stuck and started asking for hints. turns out, on the hits page, it says I found Flag 0, Flag 2, and Flag 3. Which means I&rsquo;m missing flag 1.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try and look at some of the other links again and see if I missed anything</p>
<p>Ok after some hints, I saw that there was a SQL injection in the url. Honestly, I never thought of that, I don&rsquo;t think I realized urls could be subjected to SQLi but now I do</p>
<p>putting a single quote <code>'</code> at the end of the url (page/edit/1&rsquo;) gave me the flag</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li>Write down the actual received flags!! (even if you delete them later). In a few of the sections I got the same flag because I used the same method. They were slightly different versions of XSS in different pages and fields so I wasnt sure if it was the same flag or not. I kept submitting it, and hacker101 didn&rsquo;t tell me if it was already submitted (it usually does give feedback i dont know why it is not right now) so just being able to check flags against submitted ones would be nice.</li>
<li>As is the case in the last flag (or rather Flag 1 as hacker101 calls it) check for SQLi in URLs. this will help as I go through OWASP top 10. I should both check for each part of the list, as well as make sure im checking all aspects of the list. I guess the hard part is not knowing what you dont know.</li>
